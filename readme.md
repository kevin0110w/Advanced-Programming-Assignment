The objective of this assessment was to program a rail way simulator, showing trains moving along a rail line over time.

There are two types of trains, express and slow trains. These are created randomly and placed on the first rail section immediately.

Each section of the rail line has a specific capacity. This rule is enforced by the use of Condition and Lock objects - the shared object is the rail line object.
